## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v7 or higher)
- Ionic CLI (v7 or higher)
- Angular CLI (v17 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ecomm-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure Firebase
   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Enable Authentication (Google provider)
   - Set up Firestore database
   - Update Firebase configuration in `src/environments/environment.ts` and `environment.prod.ts`

4. Run the application locally
   ```bash
   ionic serve
   ```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build for web
ionic build --prod

# Add iOS platform
ionic capacitor add ios

# Add Android platform
ionic capacitor add android

# Build and run on iOS
ionic capacitor build ios

# Build and run on Android
ionic capacitor build android
```

## Customization

### Theming

The app uses Ionic's theming system. You can customize the colors, fonts, and other design elements in `src/theme/variables.scss`.

### Adding Payment Gateways

The app is designed to be easily extended with payment gateways. Implement a payment service in the `services` directory and integrate it with the checkout process.

### Internationalization (i18n)

The application supports multiple languages with a built-in translation system:

- **Supported Languages**: English and Hindi
- **Translation Files**: Located in `src/assets/i18n/` as JSON files
- **Language Service**: Manages language switching and translation loading
- **Language Toggle**: UI component for users to switch between languages
- **Persistent Preferences**: User language preference is saved between sessions

To add a new language:
1. Create a new JSON file in `src/assets/i18n/` (e.g., `fr.json`)
2. Copy the structure from an existing language file
3. Translate all the key values
4. Update the `LanguageService` to include the new language option

## Best Practices

- **Code Organization**: Follow Angular's style guide for component and service organization
- **Performance**: Use lazy loading for routes, optimize images, and minimize HTTP requests
- **Security**: Implement proper authentication and authorization checks
- **Testing**: Write unit and integration tests for components and services
- **Documentation**: Document code and maintain up-to-date README
- **UI Consistency**: Maintain consistent UI patterns across the application
- **Internationalization**: Keep all user-facing text in translation files
- **Service Abstraction**: Use services for shared functionality (e.g., LogoutService)
